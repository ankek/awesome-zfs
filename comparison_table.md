# Comparison table for ZFS, Btrfs, XFS, Ext4, and NTFS
## ✅ Key Insights

* ZFS shines with robust features like data integrity, snapshots, replication, deduplication, encryption, and built-in RAID. It's mature and stable but not integrated into Linux kernel.

* Btrfs is a strong Linux-native alternative with similar feature sets; snapshots, send/receive, pooling, compression, and checksumming are included in the kernel. Production readiness for RAID5/6 is still evolving.

* XFS excels at high-performance large-file workloads and reliable metadata journaling but lacks CoW, snapshots, or built-in redundancy.

* Ext4 is extremely stable and compatible, suitable for general use, but lacks advanced features like pooling, snapshots, or CoW.

* NTFS is optimized for Windows with journaling, metadata management, encryption (EFS), snapshots (via VSS), and block-level virtualization, but lacks Linux-provider features like pool RAID and snapshots natively.
